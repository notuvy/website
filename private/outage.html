<h2>16 May 2011</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
  The repair technician came.
  He checked the connection box and said the signal was strong but
  there were errors on the line.
  He checked the connection to the street (across Hyannis), then checked
  the connection for the neighborhood.
  He made fixes at both these locations.
  He disconnected all the jacks except the office since they are not
  used and this increased the signal strength, but still no connection.
</p>
<p>
  The final conclusion was that the modem was defective.
  He attached a new modem and configured it, and the connection worked.
</p>

<h2>14 May 2011</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
  The internet connection was down this morning.
  (There was no problem last night.)
  Resetting resulted in the DSL light flashing then going dead.
  Going to the connection information on the modem console showed
  "no DSL synchronization".
</p>
<p>
  I called tech support and got connected to Recilia (sp?).
  She said they do not seem to have a problem on their end, so the
  DSL synchronization seems to be a connection problem on my end.
  She had me plug the modem in a different jack.
  I put it in the one by the built-in desk, and I described the startup
  sequence to her.
  She said that there must be either a basic connection problem or a
  modem malfunction.
  They need to have someone come by to check it.
<p>
  
<p>
  She created ticket WPNYN091824.
  They schedule a service visit for Monday any time (8am-8pm).
</p>

<h2>25 Apr 2011</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
  The internet connection seems to have been down since last night before
  11pm.
  Resetting the modem did not fix the problem.
</p>
<p>
  I called ATT and the rep tested the line and found no problems.
  She walked me through some steps.
  She asked me to cycle the router which I had not tried.
  She asked me to connect the PC directly to the modem and access the console.
  The connect command returned "Cannot connect to target service".
  She said that this indicated a line problem, and a subsequent test seemed
  to confirm that.
</p>
<p>
  She said she would refer the problem to the group that addresses line
  problems.
  She gave me trouble ticket "WPNYN075739" and asked me to wait for
  their automated response call.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>14 Feb 2008</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
  The system has been intermittent for two weeks.  Sometimes it is mostly
  available, but sometimes mostly unavailable.  Resetting usually has no
  effect.
</p>
<p>
  I called Comcast.  Their voicemail system said that they are aware of an
  issue in the area and they are working on it.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>27 Dec 2007</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
  The system would not get a valid IP address.  It would get "192.168.100.10"
  on a 30 second lease.  Each new lease had the same address.
</p>
<p>
  Called and worked with a tech on the issue.  He said his system reported
  that our modem was offline.  He recommended reseting the modem by
  disconnecting power AND unscrewing the cable coax.  This seemed to work
  as he saw that the system was alive.
</p>
<p>
  He then suggested reseting the modem with the router off.  This time, the
  modem did not come alive.  The "cable" light was blinking (not solid), and
  he again saw the modem was offline.  He scheduled a service tech to come
  by Sat between 1-5 [ticket # CR111414162].
</p>
<p>
  I decided to experiment by reseting the modem while the router was still
  on.  This seemed to make the modem work.  I tried to renew the network
  connection.  It took a while, but it eventually got a valid IP address.
  Although the internet connection works, it is very slow [180/300].
  By next morning, it was better [9582/1520], so I cancelled the service visit.

    <p>
      In the Spring Semester of 1993 (my final term as a graduate
      student), I worked as a reporter for the campus newpaper, "The
      Daily Illini."
      I wrote a weekly column in which I interviewed a university
      professor to discuss their research.
      The purpose was to provide a picture of the various research
      projects taking place around the campus.
      I chose professors from a variety of disciplines in order to
      expose a diverse range of projects.

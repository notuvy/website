<h1>SnipFolio</h1>
<h2>Documentation for Alpha Testing</h1>

<p class="notes">
If you downloaded an early release of the SnipFolio desktop application, you will need some documentation, so this page was created.
The contents here is admittedly short.
Comprehensive documenation would be detailed, verbose, and intimidating.
Instead, only the basic concepts are outlined here.
</p>

<h3>How to Use the Desktop Application</h3>
<p>
You should launch SnipFolio and leave it running as you use your system.
It monitors your system clipboard and helps you manage it.
It uses very little resources so it will not bog down your system.
</p>

<h3>Briefly, Why to Use it</h3>
<p>
I won't explicitly list all the different ways to use it.
Different people will find different features useful.
Several people who used it were actually surprised how useful it is.
The system clipboard is something that has been with us so long that we have
just accepted it and do not really realize how limited it is until SnipFolio
opens up many new ways to use it.
</p>

<h3>Who Will Find SnipFolio Useful</h3>
<p>
Practically every user that does cut-and-paste.
If you are the type of user that does that a lot, you find that SnipFolio lets you do use it better.
</p>

<h3>The Basic Concept</h3>
<p>
SnipFolio keeps track of everything that gets put into your system clipboard.  After you copy something, you may want to keep track of it so you can copy the snippet to a "list".  Lists are used to group related snippets.  You can create any number of lists, and name them what you want.
</p>
<p>
Importantly, lists can be "local", meaning they are only accessible on this computer, or they are "central", meaning they are accessible on other computers running SnipFolio.
Note that when you create a new list, you specify whether it will be local or central.  At any time, you can convert a local list to a central list, and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
To start using central lists, you need to create an account on the Central Storage Server.  You do this in the menu by doing "Actions &gt; Central Login &gt; Create".
This will create a unique 8-character ID.  (You may want to write it down.)
After launching SnipFolio on a different computer, you will connect it to this account by doing "Actions &gt; Central Login &gt; Set" and entering this same ID.
</p>

<h3>That's It for Now</h3>
<p>
Okay, that should be enough to get started.
If you find anything non-intuitive or difficult or missing, please report it.
(You are providing a valueable service!)

Below is a screenshot with some description of the components and features.  You do not need to study it before starting.  It may be a good resource if you are confused by what you see when you launch the application.

<ul>
  <li>The yellow shaded area at the top titled "Current System Contents" displays the text that is currently in the system clipboard.  If you do Control-V in an application, this is the snippet that will get inserted.</li>
  <li>The section below that titled "Clipboard History and Saved Entries" is all the saved lists.  Click on a tab to see the entries saved in that list.</li>
  <li>Note that the special list titled "HISTORY" is the history of what text has passed through the system clipboard, with the most recent (current) entry first and least recent last.</li>
  <li>The lists with the globe icon are "central" lists and these will be displayed in SnipFolio on all your computers.</li>
  <li>The lists with no icon are local lists which are seen only on this computer.</li>
  <li>Because each list only displays a summary of the text snippet (which may be long), the full text of the selected snippet is displayed below in the section titled "List Selection".</li>
</ul>

<h1>SnipFolio</h1>

<p>
SnipFolio moves the copy-and-paste paradigm to the cloud.
SnipFolio integrates with the system clipboard of your multiple environments (work computer, home computer, smartphone, etc.) so that as soon as a snippet is copied on one, it is available for paste on the others.
</p>

<p>
Even if you use it on a single computer, SnipFolio can be highly useful.
It maintains a history of clipboard contents so you do not lose the previous contents when you copy a snippet.<sup>1</sup>
It adds features to the basic clipboard such as:
<ul>
  <li>Grouping of snippets in persistent lists</li>
  <li>Powerful transform of contents by regular expression<sup>2</sup></li>
  <li>Simple editing of contents<sup>3</sup></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<sup>1</sup> Have you ever copied multiple fields (like name, address, phone number) from a document to a web form?
It is much faster and easier (and less error prone) to do multiple copies from the source document followed by multiple pastes in the target location than it is to keep switching between documents to do multiple copy-and-paste.
You need the history of multiple copied snippets to do this.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<sup>2</sup> Say you want to copy names from one document to another, but the source document has them in the form "Last, First" but the target document has them in the form "First Last".
You could define a transform in SnipFolio that automatically switches the order so when you copy the name, it enters the clipboard as "First Last".
You can then simply cut and paste with no manual editing in either document.
This can be a huge time saver (and error preventer).
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<sup>3</sup> Have you ever copied something that you pasted but then had to make hand modifications to?
If you are pasting and editing in multiple places, this can get tedious.
SnipFolio lets you edit the snippet while it is in the clipboard, so you can edit it once then paste it multiple times.

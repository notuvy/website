<h2>Android App</h2>

<p>
And now the Android App for SnipFolio is available for download.
Because it is an alpha version, it is a direct download rather than from the
Android marketplace.
</p>

<p>
You can click on this <span class="download"><a href="/download/snipfolio-android-0.5.4.apk">download</a></span> link to get it.
After the download is complete (notification in the status bar), you can click on the download to install it.
</p>

<p>
NOTE: You will need to enable your device to install non-Market applications.  This is done at:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Applications &gt; Unknown sources
</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Desktop Application</h2>

<p>
A preliminary version of the SnipFolio desktop application is now available
for download.
Get it from the link below.
</p>

<p>
But first, a few notes:
<ol>
  <li>SnipFolio is available right now by invitation only, so you will be asked for a username/password when you click the "Download" link.</li>
  <li>SnipFolio is a Java application, so it should work on all operating systems because most have Java installed by default. (OS-specific install instructions are below.)</li>
  <li>This version is an experimental, pre-release version.  It does contain some known defects.  Newer versions will have them fixed.</li>
  <li>This demo version does not encrypt centrally stored data.  Do NOT store sensitive data to centrally stored lists. (It is safe to store them in local lists, however.)</li>
  <li>Because of possible instability with the early version, no guarantee can be made of the continuous availability of the centrally stored lists (but every effort is made to keep data safe).</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
With all that out of the way, you can now <span class="download"><a href="/download/snipfolio-desktop-0.7.2-full.jar">Download</a></span> SnipFolio!
</p>

<p>
And once you have installed it (minimal instructions below), <a href="alphatest.html">here is some basic documentation</a> on getting started.
</p>
<hr/>

<p>
Once you have downloaded the "jar" file, you need to know what to do with it.
Here are the instructions.
<dl>
  <dt>Windows and Mac</dt>
  <dd>
    Save the file to your Desktop.  Double-click on the icon to launch the application.<br/>
    You can move it to a different location (double-click will still launch it).
  </dd>
  <dt>Linux</dt>
  <dd>
    Save the file anywhere in your file system.<br/>
    Lauch it with the command: <tt>java -jar snipfolio-desktop-1.0.0-full.jar</tt><br/>
    (Of course, use the correct version number in the command.)
  </dd>

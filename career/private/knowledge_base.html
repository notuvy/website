<h3>Environment and Execution</h3>

<h4>Memory Settings</h4>

Set data space limits by explicitly setting the initial and max heap size like
<blockquote>
  -Xms512m -Xmx1024m
</blockquote>
Note that this is for the <em>data</em>.
It may also be necessary to increase the space for metadata 
(used by the JVM, like storing all the loaded classes).
This is done like
<blockquote>
  -XX:MaxPermSize=128m
</blockquote>

<h3>Concepts</h3>

<h4>Unicode</h4>

<p>
Unicode is the univeral alphabet of characters.  
There are many ways of mapping byte sequences to the alphabet, and these are
character encodings.
</p>

<p>
Because the full Unicode alphabet contains more than 256 characters, a 
multi-byte encoding is required.
The most common choice is UTF-8 because it uses a single byte for encoding
ASCII, and multiple bytes for extended values.

<h3>What is the difference between an inner join and an outer join?</h3>
<p>
The join will combine the contents of two tables.  An inner join is used when the rows of the two tables have a one-to-one relationship.  A LEFT outer join is a many-to-one relationship, a RIGHT outer join is a one-to-many relationship, and a FULL outer join is a many-to-many relationship.

As you all know by now, this is my last day at
Rearden.  Over the last four years, I have been able
to accomplish a lot.  Both in terms of technical
achievements, and personal relationships.  I am proud
of both.  I am grateful for all you have taught me.

You can contact me at [murali24@yahoo.com].  If you
are not already in my LinkedIn network, please send
me an invite to that address.  I want to stay
connected to all of you.

Hi Salil.  I hope all is well with you.  

I have started to look for a new job.  Since you are
in contact with early-stage startups, I thought I
would ask you to keep an eye out for cool companies.

I am a core Java expert and am looking for a senior
engineer/architect position.  I am not targetting
any particular market or application area.  My
expertise is in backend development, and that type
of work is usually the same for every application.

I think my main selection criteria will be the
strength of the team.  My resume is online at
  http://muralikr.career.home.comcast.net/
and feel free to pass it along.

Hi Satnam.  How are you doing?  You must have really
enjoyed spending the summer with your boys.  (And you
must be enjoying not wearing glasses anymore!)
Things are fine with Vaishali and me.

If I remember right, you are probably looking for a
new job by now.  Actually I am also.  I don't think I
have anything more to accomplish at Rearden.  You
know my skills and interests pretty well, so let me
know if you run across anything you think I may be
interested in.

I have a couple friends who are VCs, so let me know
if you pass your resume onto them.  Pass mine on to
anyone you think may be interested. It is online at
  http://muralikr.career.home.comcast.net/

Hi Prashant.  I hope you are doing well.  It's been
quite some time since we've met.  I didn't know you
were into photography.  Rom told me you went to Bode
with him for the class.

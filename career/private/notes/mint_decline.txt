Hello David.  I am sorry to say that I will not be
accepting the job offer with Mint.  I feel I owe it
to you to give you more details of my decision
process.

As I mentioned in our phone conversation, I am accepting
a position with Krillion (http://www.krillion.com/).

It was a difficult decision.  I went back and forth
between the offers numerous times.  I felt that both
companies had a strong team.  Both were offering a
similar, back-end architecture position.

Mint's advantage was that it was at an earlier stage
and thus my contribution would have a more immediate
impact on the product design.  I fully appreciate that
you offered me the Software Architect title.

I know Mint will be backed by an A-list funder soon.
Krillion's main funder is Hummer Winblad, which is a
firm that I highly respect.

In terms of objective measures, Krillion offered a
higher salary ($130K vs. $110K) and a larger amount of
stock (0.65% vs. 0.45%).  Although these differences
clearly enhanced the Krillion offer, they were not
solely the deciding factor.

One of the key deciding factors was that the Krillion
CEO has a public blog where he shares his professional
and personal philosophies.  I really respected that he
would put all of that out there for public consumption.

My biggest regret, David, is that I will not be working
with you personally.  In our conversations, it was clear
that you are an sharp person with the right ideas on how
to do engineering.  It was very difficult for me to tell
you that I would not be accepting the offer.

I have no doubt that Mint will be a success.  The
idea and the team are solid.  In fact, I would like
to remain a friend of Mint and I would encourage my
smartest friends to consider Mint in their job search.

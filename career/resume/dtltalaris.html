<p class="worksub">
  <span class="jobtitle">Senior Software Engineer</span>,
  <span class="daterange">November 2002 - January 2007</span>
</p>

<p class="sectionhead">Overview</p>

<p class="section">
  In my tenure at Rearden Commerce, I have made significant contributions
  in a variety of areas in the Engineering department.
  My responsibilities encompass original design of platform frameworks,
  design and development of functional features, performance-oriented
  design and trouble-shooting, and development process design.
</p>

<!-- BLOCK ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<p class="sectionhead">Framework Design</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">Transaction Framework</p>
<p class="section">
  I proactively conceived, designed, and implemented a mechanism for managing
  local transactions (DB and JMS).
  This facility allows developers to make a piece of logic transactional
  by simply denoting a section of thread-wise logic to be transactional.
  All relevant information is stored with the thread of execution.
  This feature allowed the core architecture to be redesigned to not
  use EJB for transactionality, thereby reducing operating cost by deploying
  the application in the tomcat application server instead of the WebLogic
  application server.
</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">Measurement Framework</p>
<p class="section">
  I conceived, designed, and implemented a framework for representing
  convertible measurement values (value and units data).
  The existing OR mapping layer was extended to include support for this
  framework.
  This framework was also extended to represent currency values as units,
  allowing the entire application to represent monetary values in any of
  a set of supported currencies.
  These facilities allowed the application design to be extended for
  international usage.
</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">DB Access Layer</p>
<p class="section">
  In order to avoid the complexity and fragility of writing direct JDBC
  logic, I implemented an abstraction by which DB operations can be written
  without any explicit handling of the underlying DB connections or connection
  pool.
  This was developed from scratch, but is similar to the jakarta commons
  <a target="resref" href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/dbutils/">DbUtils</a> package.
  
</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">Workflow State Object Model</p>
<p class="section">
  I implemented many refactorings where primitive constants were replaced
  by object constants in an attempt to make the application design more
  object-oriented.
  The biggest such project was the effort to replace the representation of
  workflow process states from integers (using static methods to define
  behavior) to rich objects.
  This immediately uncovered hidden bugs and made the framework extensible.
</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">DB Connection Leak Detection</p>
<p class="section">
  Because the leak of DB connections is a serious problem, I devised a
  mechanism by which connections are registered/deregistered when they
  are allocated/released.
  This allows a running system to be intraspected to see current usage.
  There is also a monitor that detects and reports when a connection is in
  use for a long period of time and thus is a potential leak.
</p>

<!-- BLOCK ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<p class="sectionhead">Functional Component Development</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">Address Validation Module</p>
<p class="section">
  I incorporated a third party address validation package.
  A generic facade was designed to access this service, so client logic
  used a simplified API, while the underlying implementation provided
  round-robin connection pooling, and provided conditional access to
  multiple data sources.
</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">Zombie Process Terminator</p>
<p class="section">
  The application contains a workflow engine which needed a mechanism to
  detect and terminate process that had escaped from the control of the engine.
  We identified several scenarios where this could happen.
  I designed a pluggable framework in which terminators for different
  conditions could be defined.
</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">User Profile Load</p>
<p class="section">
  I designed an implemented an import mechanism to define user accounts in
  the system based on a company's directory dump.
  The tool took the company XML file, transformed it to a standard
  (Rearden-defined) XML format, loaded it into DB tables, then triggered a
  stored procedure to finish the load.
  A mechanism to activate user accounts based on simple rules was also
  implemented.
</p>

<!-- BLOCK ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<p class="sectionhead">Process Design</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">Build Design</p>
<p class="section">
  I took on the role of the principal designer of the build system.
  I standardized and structured the build (ant) system, included how
  source files are compiled, JSPs are compiled, and how the application
  is deployed.
</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">Automated Test Framework</p>
<p class="section">
  Although a junit based testing framework existed prior to my joining, it
  was crudely implemented and did not properly follow the junit paradigm.
  I rewrote the framework by partitioning the suite into independent tests
  which are run with every hourly build, and interdependent tests which are
  run with every nightly build.
</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">Application Componentization</p>
<p class="section">
  When I started, all the source was in a single module, and built into a
  single jar file.
  I began the effort of breaking the application into many modular components.
  This was a major effort because it required refactoring the source code to
  eliminate circular dependencies between separate components.
  The build needed to be redesigned to handle the new structure.
</p>

<!-- BLOCK ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<p class="sectionhead">Tools Design</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">DB Connection Management Paradigm Checker</p>
<p class="section">
  To avoid the serious problem of the leak of DB connections, I wrote a
  source code analysis tool (Perl) which parses the whole code base and
  detects improper paradigm usage.
  This is run with every hourly build, so problems are reported before the
  application is deployed.
</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">Source Code Style Management</p>
<p class="section">
  I worked on a committee that determined what common coding style guidelines
  to adopt.
  To simplify adherence, I wrote a tool (separate Java program) to rewrite
  source code files to match the guidelines.
  The tool is automatically invoked during the build process.
</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">Module Dependency Calculation</p>
<p class="section">
  I designed a tool that process the system build files to calculate the
  dependencies of the separate source code modules.
  It does this by reading the classpath for each module and constructing a
  directed acyclic graph representing the dependencies.
  This was essential for the correct design of new modules, and the
  partitioning of the existing modules into separate ones.
  It is also used to calculate the correct order of build.
</p>

<p class="sectionhead">Presentations</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">Testing and Development</p>
<p class="section">
  I gave a presentation to the Engineering department on modern automated
  software testing philosophies and best practices.
  I outlined the frameworks I developed and demonstrated the benefits of
  the system.
</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">Performance</p>
<p class="section">
  I collected my observations on the many coding practices in the application
  source where non-optimal performance was introduced.
  I gave a presentation to the Engineering department with my findings and
  gave suggestions on how to fix the problems and on how to avoid problems
  in the future.

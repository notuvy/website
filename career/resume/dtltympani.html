  <span class="jobtitle">Senior Engineer</span>,

</p>

<p class="section">
  I was a principal architect and developer
  for the Tympani Atlas Server, a server-centered 
  Internet information management tool and corporate
  portal.
  Atlas is a multiuser environment where individuals can
  download Internet information and import unstructured
  data, then process and filter the information, and share
  it with other users in the organization.
  I was involved in all stages of development from the initial
  design through the deployment as a commercial software package.
</p>

<p class="section">
  I was responsible for a significant part of the server
  development (C++), which is 
  integrated with a Versant Object Database and an Apache web
  server.
  I was fully responsible for the 
  design and development of the Java applet 
  component of the user interface.
  I developed the installation and configuration scripts for the
  Unix version of the product, and served as the primary point
  of contact for customers using the Unix version.
</p>

<p class="section">
  I was the primary designer and developer of a separate
  extranet management tool, which was a spinoff of the Atlas
  Server.
</p>

<p class="section">
  In addition to the design of Atlas itself,
  I developed automated procedures and scripts (Perl)
  for testing and release packaging.

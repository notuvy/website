  <span class="jobtitle">Software Engineer</span>,
  <span class="daterange">August 1993 - April 1997</span>
</p>

<p class="section">
  I was the primary developer responsible for the design and
  implementation (C++) of an
  uncertainty reasoning logic module of an autonomous
  control logic software package for unmanned underwater vehicles.
</p>

<p class="section">
  I designed and implemented (Smalltalk)
  a software package that enables an end user
  to graphically lay out a test mission and generate the 
  resulting data input for simulation.
</p>

<p class="section">
  I designed and implemented (Smalltalk)
  a software package that presents raw data
  generated by simulation tests in a processed (graphical and
  quantitative) format.
  This tool allowed system engineers to evaluate simulation data
  more quickly and accurately, thus speeding the development
  cycle, and earned a departmental award.
</p>

<p class="section">
  I coordinated a software testing policy and implemented 
  (Perl scripts) an automated
  testing procedure for the system software.
  The scripts allowed development engineers to run simulation
  tests themselves rather than relying on testers to schedule
  them.
  This led to a significant increase in productivity and earned
  a departmental award.
</p>

<p class="section">
  I was rated as the top performer in department at my experience level.

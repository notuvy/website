<p class="workhead">Krillion Summary: Murali Krishnan</p>
<p class="worksub">
  <span class="jobtitle">Senior Engineer</span>,
  <span class="daterange">February 2007 - present</span>
</p>

<p class="sectionhead">Overview</p>

<p class="section">
  I joined Krillion when the company totalled 12 people including 6
  engineers.
  My responsibility was with general back-end logic and various functional
  areas.
</p>

<p class="section">
  I was involved in several components of the back-end architecture.
  I was the primary designer of the data engine.
</p>

<p class="sectionhead">Framework Design and Data Architecture</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">Data Processing Lifecycle</p>
<p class="section">
  I took ownership of the critical framework for processing the collected
  raw data and creating the final rich data set at the core of all Krillion
  products.
  I transformed a sequence of manual steps into an automated process
  I converted the original process of full data classification and streamlined
  it to only process new data for each release.
</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">Classification Rules Engine</p>
<p class="section">
  I designed the rules-based expert system used to classify raw product data.
  The custom design used Java regular expression logic along with domain
  knowledge to convert raw records into identifiable objects.
</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">Data Comparison Logic</p>
<p class="section">
  I designed the system to compare current data snapshots to previous
  release to measure data quality and regression.
</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">Cross-Correlation and Product Merging</p>
<p class="section">
  I designed the system where products referenced by UPC, Model Number,
  Manufacturer Part Number, ASIN (Amazon ID), and title are merged.
  This is a complicated problem where partially identified records are
  combined to a normalized form.
  This requires the detection and correction of erroneous records.
  It also requires lookup of products in external systems (Amazon, Affiliate
  records) to populate missing fields.
</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">Price Model</p>
<p class="section">
  I designed the datamodel for representing product prices.
  This included the representation of current regular and sale prices, plus
  historical prices.
</p>

<p class="sectionhead">Functional Component Development</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">Product Attributes</p>
<p class="section">
  I designed and implemented the framework for deduction and
  classification of product attributes.
  This is the complicated task of reading a product's title, description, and
  specifications, and deducing all of it's properties.
  A general framework needed to be defined so for any new product category
  that is defined, the attributes could be quickly defined and the logic to
  extract them could be easily implemented.
</p>
<p class="section">
  This was a challenging exercise in recognizing patterns in ambiguous,
  inconsistent data and consolidating information from multiple sources.
</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">Product Availability</p>
<p class="section">
  I designed and implemented the initial framework for performing live product
  availability checking.
  To check if a product is in stock, an HTTP request is performed for each
  retailer that carries the product, and the result data (from the spider) is
  processed and presented to the UI layer for display.
</p>
<p class="section">
  The challenge in architecting this component is to design the API to the
  UI layer that provides all the necessary functionality yet hides the
  complexity (like handling of timeouts and other errors).
</p>

<p class="sectionlabel">Data File Sharing (DataBank)</p>
<p class="section">
  I designed the data repository for the intermediate steps of the
  processing lifecycle.
  This custom-designed component enabled multiple developers to
  concurrently work on the data processing lifecycle.
</p>
<p class="section">
  This component was key to seemless cooperation between the California
  engineering team and the offshore (India) office.
</p>


<p class="sectionlabel">Application Intraspection (Scope)</p>
<p class="section">
  I introduced the concept of a monitoring and administration module
  for the main web application.
  This tool increased productivity by providing quick and convenient
  access to internal application data for monitoring and general
  investigation.

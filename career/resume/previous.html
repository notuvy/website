      and design, through development, to testing and deployment.
      I want to work in a group where team members 
      leverage each other's talents, and for a company that is dedicated
      to delivering quality software.
      I am seeking a position with a high level of responsibility, and
      one which will allow me to exercise technical leadership.

	<b>EMPLOYMENT HISTORY</b>
    </p>

    <ul>

    <p>
	<b><a target="resref" href="http://www.talaris.com/">Talaris Corporation</a>, San Mateo, CA</b><br>
	  <b>Senior Software Engineer</b><br>
	    <i>November 2002 - present</i><br>
    </p>

    <p>
	<b><a target="resref" href="http://www.iona.com">IONA Technologies Inc.</a>,
	  Santa Clara, CA</b><br>
	  <b>Senior Engineer</b><br>
	    <i>December 1999 - August 2002</i><br>
            Note: I was originally employed by Netfish Technologies,
            which was acquired by IONA Technologies in May 2001.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <p>
        I was a senior member of the infrastructure group which developed
        the core functionality of Collaborate, one of the company's
        software products.
        Collaborate is a platform for (XML) standards-based business to
        business document exchange, and is a large Java application run
        in an application server.
        I was the primary designer for several features and contributed
        to the development of many other product modules.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was the principle designer and developer for the Trading Partner
        Management module.
        I collected requirements from all users of this module, implemented
        the functionality (including DB persistence), and established
        automated tests for the module which ensured robustness and quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        I designed a system to monitor system resource saturation and
        perform inbound data throttling.
        This was a generalized framework which allowed many different
        modules to contribute to a system-wide determination of 'saturation',
        and then used this flag to gracefully reject inbound documents until
        resources returned to availability.
        After determining the need for this feature through
        my own observations of system performance under heavy
        load, I proposed it to the technical leads and it was accepted. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I developed a framework for performance measurement.
        This simple, non-intrusive functionality used the system clock and
        correlated all the units of work performed by multiple threads.
        It produced a simple time-line report which allowed throughput to
        be measured in the highly threaded system.
        I identified the need for this functionality and I designed the
        entire framework, which became the standard measurement tool for
        the performance measurement/improvement initiative.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my primary software development responsibilities,
        I designed the software build system.
        I participated in the design of the automated unit test system
        and was a principle contributor in the evaluation, measurement,
        and improvement of the product performance.
        Because of my system-wide knowledge and general programming
        skills, I was often enlisted to address critical bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was a principle developer for the team implementing a business
        registry for
        <a target="resref" href="http://www.xmlbus.com">XMLBus</a>, the
        company's Web Services product.
        I developed an implementation of the JAXR API, which was then
        exposed as a Web Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        I briefly worked with the consulting group where my responsibilities
        included installing/configuring the software at customer sites,
        interfacing and supporting customers, and designing and executing
        training classes.
      </p>
    </ul>

    <p>
	<b>Tympani Development Inc., Sunnyvale, CA</b><br>
	  <b>Senior Engineer</b><br>
	    <i>April 1997 - December 1999</i><br>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <p>
	I was a principle architect and developer
	for the Tympani Atlas Server, a server-centered 
	Internet information management tool and corporate
	portal.
	Atlas is a multiuser environment where individuals can
	download Internet information and import unstructured
	data, then process and filter the information, and share
	it with other users in the organization.
	I was involved in all stages of development from the initial
	design through the deployment as a commercial software package.
      </p>
      <p>
	I was responsible for a significant part of the server
	development (C++), which is 
	integrated with a Versant Object Database and the Apache web
	server.
	I was fully responsible for the 
	design and development of the Java applet 
	component of the user interface.
	I developed the installation and configuration scripts for the
	Unix version of the product, and served as the primary point
	of contact for customers using the Unix version.
      </p>
      <p>
	I was the primary designer and developer of a separate
	extranet management tool, which was a spinoff of the Atlas
	Server.
      </p>
      <p>
	In addition to the design of Atlas itself,
	I developed automated procedures and scripts (Perl)
	for testing and release packaging.
      </p>
    </ul>


    <p>
      <b>Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space, Palo Alto, CA</b><br>
	<B>Software Engineer</B><BR>
	  <I>August 1993 - April 1997</I> <BR>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <p>
	I was the primary developer responsible for the design and
	implementation (C++) of an
	uncertainty reasoning logic module of an autonomous
	control logic software package for unmanned underwater vehicles.
      </p>
      <p>
	I designed and implemented (Smalltalk)
	a software package that enables an end user
	to graphically lay out a test mission and generate the 
	resulting data input for simulation.
      </p>
      <p>
	I designed and implemented (Smalltalk)
	a software package that presents raw data
	generated by simulation tests in a processed (graphical and
	quantitative) format.
	This tool allowed system engineers to evaluate simulation data
	more quickly and accurately, thus speeding the development
	cycle, and earned a departmental award.
      </p>
      <p>
	I coordinated a software testing policy and implemented 
	(Perl scripts) an automated
	testing procedure for the system software.
	The scripts allowed development engineers to run simulation
	tests themselves rather than relying on testers to schedule
	them.
	This led to a significant increase in productivity and earned
	a departmental award.
      </p>
      <p>
	I was rated as the top performer in department at my experience
	level.
      </p>
    </ul>


    <p>
      <b>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</b> <br>
	<b>Teaching Assistant</b> <br>
	  <i>January 1991 - May 1993</i><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <p>
	I instructed groups of 20 to 40 students in introductory computer 
	science. I reviewed and edited course material in an elementary 
	numerical methods class. My responsibilities also included 
	supervising the work of two undergraduate graders and designing 
	programming assignments, quizzes, and exams.
      </p>

        I am the author and sole developer of the open source project
        <a target="resref" href="http://fsgrep.sourceforge.net/">Fsgrep</a>, a
        multiple file, regular expression based search tool.
        The source code is distributed with the download, so it is a
        concrete example of my design skills and coding style.

        I am a contributing developer on the open source project
        <a target="resref" href="http://follow.sourceforge.net/">Follow</a>, a

	<b>SKILL SET</b>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <p>
	I have worked with a wide variety of programming languages
	and software packages.
	The list below represents the areas of my most recent
	exposure, and is not meant to be comprehensive.
	I have a preference for objected oriented design because
	it inherently creates a decoupled, modular framework, which
	is critical for group development.
	The development of automated procedures is of particular interest
	to me.
        In all my assignments, I have taken the initiative
	to develop time-saving programs and scripts.

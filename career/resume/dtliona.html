<p class="workhead">IONA Technologies Summary: Murali Krishnan</p>
<p class="worksub">
  <span class="jobtitle">Senior Engineer</span>,
  <span class="daterange">December 1999 - August 2002</span>
</p>

<p class="note">
I was originally at <b>Netfish Technologies</b>,
which was acquired by IONA Technologies in May 2001.</i>
</p>

<p class="section">
  I was a senior member of the infrastructure group which developed
  the core functionality of Collaborate, one of the company's
  software products.
  Collaborate is a platform for (XML) standards-based business to
  business document exchange and is a large Java application run
  in an application server.
  I was the primary designer for several features and contributed
  to the development of many other product modules.
</p>

<p class="section">
  I was the principal designer and developer for the Trading Partner
  Management module.
  I collected requirements from all users of this module, implemented
  the functionality (including DB persistence), and established
  automated tests for the module which ensured robustness and quality.
</p>

<p class="section">
  I designed a system to monitor system resource saturation and
  perform inbound data throttling.
  This was a generalized framework which allowed many different
  modules to contribute to a system-wide determination of 'saturation',
  and then used this flag to gracefully reject inbound documents until
  resources returned to availability.
  After determining the need for this feature through
  my own observations of system performance under heavy
  load, I proposed it to the technical leads and it was accepted. 
</p>

<p class="section">
  I developed a framework for performance measurement.
  This simple, non-intrusive functionality used the system clock and
  correlated all the units of work performed by multiple threads.
  It produced a simple time-line report which allowed throughput to
  be measured in the highly threaded system.
  I identified the need for this functionality and I designed the
  entire framework, which became the standard measurement tool for
  the performance measurement/improvement initiative.
</p>

<p class="section">
  In addition to my primary software development responsibilities,
  I designed the software build system.
  I participated in the design of the automated unit test system
  and was a principal contributor in the evaluation, measurement,
  and improvement of the product performance.
  Because of my system-wide knowledge and general programming
  skills, I was often enlisted to address critical bugs.
</p>

<p class="section">
  I was a principal developer for the team implementing a business
  registry for XMLBus, the company's Web Services product.
  I developed an implementation of the JAXR API, which was then
  exposed as a Web Service.
</p>

<p class="section">
  I briefly worked with the consulting group where my responsibilities
  included installing/configuring the software at customer sites,
  interfacing and supporting customers, and designing and executing
  training classes.

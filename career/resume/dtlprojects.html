<h1>Extracurricular Software Projects</h1>

<p>
  Besides the software development I do at work, I also work on several
  projects on my own.
  Some of them are open source projects, and many are just for my own use.
  Although there may be publicly available software packages that do some
  of the things these do, I specifically wanted to develop these on my
  own.
  Sometimes it is to ensure that a particular feature is implemented.
  Sometimes it is to get practice with particular technologies (e.g.
  image processing, XML, etc.).
  Always there is an opportunity to enhance my design and refactoring
  skills.

  which provides a simple mechanism to make Java desktop applications singleton instances.
  It enforces that only one instance of an application (or one per user) is allowed to run on the system.
  The developer can easily configure whether a new instance will defer to an existing instance, or preempt it.

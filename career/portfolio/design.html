<a name="interface"></a>
<h3>Generalization by Interface</h3>

<p class="section">
  One measure of how much an engineer understands object oriented
  principles it so see how much <code>instanceof</code> usage is
  found in the design.
  There are very few places where its usage is acceptable.
  These are principally in methods called by the Collections framework
  (e.g. <code>equals()</code>, <code>compareTo()</code>) since,
  historically, Java allows heterogeneous collections.
</p>
<p class="section">
  The correct approach is to look at logic where objects of different
  classes are encountered and to ask "Can the different classes be
  generalized in a single interface?"
</p>
<p class="section">
  A Week can contain DayOfMonth or DayOfWeek instances.  Only the DayOfMonth
  objects need to be marked.
  So it might be tempting to check for that type of object and act only
  on that:
</p>
<pre>
    Iterator iterator = getMap().values().iterator();
    while (iterator.hasNext()) {
        Object object = iterator.next();
        if (object instanceof DayOfMonth) {
            DayOfMonth dow = (DayOfMonth) object;
            dom.mark(pRange);
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="section">
    But this ignores a cleaner, object oriented option.
    The better approach is to recognize that both types of objects that are
    contained in a Week can be called to mark themselves as members of a
    Range.
    Therefore, we can create a Markable interface implemented by both
    DayOfMonth and DayOfWeek.
    The former can implement it appropriately, and the latter can give an
    empty implementation (NOOP).
    The logic then becomes:
<pre>
    Iterator iterator = getMap().values().iterator();
    while (iterator.hasNext()) {
        Markable markable = (Markable) iterator.next();
        markable.mark(pRange);
    }
</pre>
</p>

<a name="enumeration"></a>
<h3>Enumerated Objects</h3>

<p><strong>Note that the Enum type was added in Java 5, making this construct unnecessary.  It is still included here because this was written originally when Java 4 was the latest release.</strong></p>

<p class="section">
  Often when it is necessary to define constants, an inexperienced programmer
  will define them using primitive types.
  Then when it is necessary to determine properties of the enumeration, a
  static method will be used with a switch/if to drive the logic.
  For example, the DayOfWeek implementation could be implemented as:
<pre>
    public static final int SUN = 1;
    public static final int MON = 2;
    public static final int TUE = 3;

    public static String toString(int pDayOfWeek) {
        String result = "Undefined";

        switch (pDayOfWeek) {

        case SUN:
            result = "SUN";
            break;

        case MON:
            result = "MON";
            break;

        case TUE:
            result = "TUE";
            break;

        default:
            break;
        }

        return (result);
    }
</pre>
</p>

<p class="section">
  This is a common mistake which results from a lack of understanding of
  basic object oriented principles.
  Only if the <i>actual</i> value of the constant is a primitive should the
  constant be of a primitive type.
  Sure, it may be necessary to have an underlying representation that is a
  primitive, but this a replacement of the <i>abstraction</i> with the
  <i>implementation</i>.
</p>

<p class="section">
  The actual implementation of DayOfWeek uses constants that are objects
  that expose behavior, but not the underlying implementation.
  DayOfWeek is defined as an abstract class, and the constant are the
  instantiation of concrete inner classes.
  (Note that it is strictly not necessary to use inner classes, but it
  is preferred in this case because no client logic needs to know the
  actual representation.)
  The enumeration now uses the Flyweight pattern.
  A primitive type (int) is used to create distinct implementations, but
  this is not exposed int the public API.
  Because it is a simple class, it was possible to use the Factory pattern
  by having static factory methods.
</p>

<a name="nullpattern"></a>
<h3>Undefined Objects instead of null</h3>
<p class="section">
  This is a key part of any design, so let me go into the issue in some
  detail.
  There is a bad tendency in Java programming to initialize objects to
  <code>null</code>, or to use <code>null</code> to denote and 'undefined'
  value.
  Many programmers do this because several parts of the Java class library
  do this (e.g. <code>Map.get(Object)</code> returns null if the given key
  is not in the map).
  However, this must be avoided except in the <i>rare</i> occasion that it 
  must be done.
  If the execution of the application regularly produces null pointer
  exceptions, it it almost certainly due to this poor programming practice.
</p>
<p class="section">
  The problem with using <code>null</code> to represent any kind of value
  (including 'undefined', 'uninitialized', 'unknown', etc.) is that it is
  not a value; not an object.
  It cannot give any information about itself.
</p>
<p class="section">
  The correct approach is to define a specific object to denote the
  'undefined' value.
</p>
<p class="section">
  In this example, a Week is a collection of days, but the first and/or the
  last week of a month may not be completely filled.
</p>

<a name="visitor"></a>
<h3>Visitor/Dispatch Pattern</h3>

<p class="section">
  We have created a custom object (<code>DayDate</code>) to represent the
  date, rather than using the <code>Date</code> class directly.
  This creates the issue of how to use a <code>DateFormatter</code> to
  do formatting, because its <code>format()</code> takes a <code>Date</code>
  as a parameter.
  The incorrect approach is to expose the underlying representation:
<pre>
    static final DateFormat FORMATTER = new SimpleDateFormat("dd MMM yyyy");
    DayDate day = new DayDate();
    System.out.println(FORMATTER.format(day.getDate());  // BAD: implementation [getDate()] is exposed.
</pre>
</p>
<p class="section">
    This compromises object oriented design.
    It should be recognized that there is no need to expose the
    implementation here.
    The correct approach is to pass the formatter to the <code>DayDate</code>
    object and have it use the implementation <i>internally</i>.
    This way, the client logic does not care how a <code>DayDate</code> is
    implemented, it just knows that it can be formatted with a
    <code>DateFormat</code>:
<pre>
    DayDate day = new DayDate();
    System.out.println(day.format(FORMATTER));
</pre>
</p>

<a name="stringwriter"></a>
<h3>Usage of StringWriter instead of StringBuffer</h3>
<p class="section">
    Often Java programmers unthinkingly use <code>StringBuffer</code>
    (either explicitly or implicitly via the <code>+</code> operator on
    strings) to construct large string results.
    This is one of the more inefficient ways to do string construction
    because of the large number of objects that get constructed and copied
    in the process.
</p>
<p class="section">
    The example avoided this problem in the implementation of the
    <code>toHtml()</code> of all <code>Printable</code> objects by passing
    in a <code>StringWriter</code> that each object writes to.
    Also, all logic calls the writer's <code>write()</code> method multiple
    times instead of using the <code>+</code> operator on strings.
</p>
<p class="section">
    Admittedly, the performance improvement gained by this paradigm is
    likely negligible in an application of this small size.
    Performance effects would be noticeable in a larger-scale application.
</p>

<a name="regex"></a>
<h3>Usage Regular Expressions instead of String Manipulation</h3>
<p class="section">
    String data manipulation is a common action in many applications.
    The earlier versions of Java provided only rudimentary tools for this.
    Later versions introduced regular expressions, and this is a superior
    way to do all string manipulation (except for cases where performance
    is paramount).
</p>
<p class="section">
    The problem with the rudimentary string tools (<code>indexOf()</code>,
    <code>substring()</code>, etc.) is that their usage produces unreadable
    logic.
    Since they rely in indexing, it is common to find that this logic
    introduces off-by-one errors and boundary errors.
</p>
<p class="section">
    Usage of regular expressions greatly simplifies the logic, and makes it
    much more readable (and hence more error-free and more maintainable).
</p>

<a name="composition"></a>
<h3>Proper Composition of Component Objects</h3>
<p class="section">
  This problem naturally lends itself to a cascading series of
  container/component relationships:<br/>
  HtmlCal / Month / Week / DayOfMonth.
</p>
<p class="section">
  It is important to design the classes so that a container object deals only
  with the type of object it contains.
  For example, an <code>HtmlCal</code> object deals with <code>Month</code>
  objects, but never with the <code>Week</code> objects contained in the
  <code>Month</code>.
  All objects delegate all operations to their component object, which may
  in turn do the same.
</p>
<p class="section">
  In this relationship, the contained object never directly references its
  container.
  Its responsibility is to manage its compnents and to act independently
  of how itself may be contained/aggregated.
</p>
<p class="section">
  The strength of this model is the level of independece of all elements.
  This property makes flexible and extensible.
</p>

<a name="encapsulation"></a>
<h3>Proper Encapsulation of the Lowest-Level Data Object</h3>
<p class="section">
  Because this project deals with dates, it may be initially tempting to use
  one of the built-in datatypes (<code>Date</code> or <code>Calendar</code>)
  to represent the smallest unit of data, which is a calendar day.
  After some investigation, it will be clear that either of these would not
  be an exact fit because the requirements of a calendar day includes
  functionality from both of these classes.

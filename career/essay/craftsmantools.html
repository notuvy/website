<h1>A Craftsman's Tools</h1>

<p>
  There are several television shows on PBS where master craftsmen
  explain their trade mostly for the benefit of hobbyists.
  A good example is
  <a href="http://www.newyankee.com/index.shtml">The New Yankee Workshop</a>,
  where a furniture-maker create pieces from raw materials.
  Even for the non-hobbist, these programs are entertaining because it
  is a chance to see a master craftsman at work.
  It is amazing to see the effortlessness and speed with which a
  beautiful, functional piece of furniture can be created from its
  raw materials
</p>
<p>
  Part of the speed comes from the craftsman's use of power tools.
  Often his collection includes many specialized tools that a typical hobbyist
  would not possess.
  It is tempting to to think that the difference between the hobbyist
  and the master is only the many powerful tools.
  However, that is a fallacy.
  The tools only increase the master's speed and efficiency.
  They do not confer any added skill.
  Often the effortlessness of the master masks the deep, rich skillset.
</p>
<p>
  An experienced craftsman could accomplish the same results using the more
  primitive tools of earlier generations.
  The only difference would be that it would take a much longer time
  to reach an end goal.
  For a hobbyist, the power tools might be a crutch that enable some
  accomplishments not possible with primitive tools, due to a lack of
  skill.
  For the master, the power tools are merely a convenience and a time
  saving mechanism.
</p>
<p>
  A true master would be capable of actually inventing and building new
  <i>tools</i> themselves.
  This is a task well beyond a hobbyist (almost by definition).
</p>
<p>
  The same principle holds in the realm of software design.

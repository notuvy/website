<h1>A Craftsman's Tools</h1>

<p>
  There are several television shows on PBS where master craftsmen
  explain their trade mostly for the benefit of hobbyists.
  A good example is
  <a href="http://www.newyankee.com/index.shtml">The New Yankee Workshop</a>,
  where a furniture-maker create pieces from raw materials.
  There are parallels between the woodcrafts and software design.
  It is instructive to discuss furniture design as an analog to software
  design because furniture design creates a physical product with clearly
  identifyable skills, unlike software design.
</p>
<p>
  It is clear to see what the difference between a furniture designer
  and a carpenter are.
  The latter undoubtedly is a position that requires honed skills and
  some level of inate talent.
  However, the former encompasses all those skills, and requires yet
  more.
  Simply put, a furniture designer can do basic carpentry, but a mere
  carpenter may not be able to original design work.
</p>
<p>
  Being a furniture designer goes beyond cutting, shaping, and fastening
  the wooden parts (in themselves, no simple feat).
  It requires the ability to visualize all the roles a piece of furniture
  will play before undertaking construction.
  It requires a knowledge of historical styles and techniques.
  It involves understanding how a single piece fits with the existing
  environment, and possible future uses.
  For example, any carpenter can build a table, but if one wants the
  <i>right</i> for a <i>specific use</i>, then it would be better to
  work with a master craftsman.
</p>
<p>
  The analog in the software realm is with software engineers and
  programmers.
  Programming is a skill that requires years of mastery.
  Unlike carpentry, however, it does not produce a physical product that
  a layman would be able to evaluate.
  A software engineer is much more than a programmer.
  An engineer can program (and must be able to do it well), but can also
  understand a problem and design a solution.
</p>
<p>
  To solve a problem that requires designing an algorithm, both a
  programmer and an engineer can do a good job.
  Algorithm design requires a knowledge of the problem space and the
  cleverness to find a solution.

<h1>A Machine's Job</h1>

<p>
  There is an old saying that comes from several tradition cultures:
  <span class="quote">Never send a boy to do a man's job.</span>
  The point of this is there are some tasks for which skill and
  maturity are required.
  Whoever is assigned the work must be capable of it.
</p>

<p>
  In my software development philosophy, I have adopted a variation of
  this saying:
  <span class="quote">Never send a man to do a machine's job.</span>
  (Note that this statement preserves the gender-bias of the
  original only in order to sound like a direct extension.
  The gender is irrelevant to the point.
  The word "human" here instead of "man" would be more apt.)
</p>
<p>
  The point here is that there are some tasks that are not only
  suitable for automation, but preferable.
  Many everyday activities done during the course of software development
  are a series of rote steps (e.g. compile a file, then copy the file,
  then transfer the file).
  Rather than having a person do these each time, an automated task can be
  created.
  The simplest tasks can be done by shell or batch scripts.
  Tasks that need more parameterization or complex logic should probably
  be done in a scripting language, like Perl or Ruby.
  Tasks with even more complex logic will need to be developed in an
  application programming language, like Java.
</p>
<p>
  Any time a developer finds that an activity has been engaged in
  multiple times, it is time to consider automating the task.
  There are several reasons for this, which are further detailed below:
  <ul>
    <li>Reliability</li>
    <li>Speed of Execution</li>
    <li>Automatic Documentation</li>
  </ul>
  Of course, there is a cost incurred with automation.
  Developing the automated process requires resources.
  In most cases, the cost is recovered very quickly because of the
  tangible benefits.
  Only in the case where the process is infrequent and complex would
  automation be ineffective (in which case, it is <b>not</b> a
  machine's job).
</p>

<h2>Reliability</h2>
<p class="section">
  Anytime a human engages in repetitive activity, the likelihood of error
  grows.
  It increases both with the number of repetitions, and with the number
  of steps within each cycle.
  This is because the human mind disengages with repetition.
  A person will be fully involved (mentally) during the first iteration.
  With each subsequent iteration, the absorption in detail is diminished.
  This is no defect; it is human nature.
</p>

<p class="section">
  No such problem exist with automated processes.
  A shell script works exactly the same each time it runs.
  It is usually easy to automate a general case scenario.
  To handle special cases and corner cases, either more complicated logic
  could be added to the automaton, or the simple process could recognize
  the case, abort, and let a human handle it.
  This is still an improvement because the majority of the cases are handled
  in the automatic manner, and the human will have sufficient engagement to
  deal with the special case.
</p>

<h2>Speed of Execution</h2>
<p class="section">
  This is mostly self-explanatory.
  An automated process in constant in both its speed of execution and the
  quality of execution.
  However, with a human these factors are in inverse proportion to each other.
</p>

<h2>Automatic Documentation</h2>
<p class="section">
  The ability for the automation script to actually serve as the documentation
  for the process is a sometimes overlooked benefit.
  If the process was a manual series of steps, then for one person to transfer
  knowledge to another, it is necessary to document the steps.
  However, if the process was automated, then the only aspect to document
  is how to execute the automated process.
  Anyone interested to know the details of the process can view the source
  code for the automation.
</p>
<p class="section">
  It is also important to note that this eliminates a synchronization
  problem.
  If a manual process was documented, then any change to the process would
  render the documentation out of date (and usually incorrect documentation
  is worse than missing documentation).
  A self-documenting script will never have this problem, which is a tangible
  improvement to process efficiency.

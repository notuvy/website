<h4>The elegance of a simple machine.</h4>

<p>
  Several open source projects are developed under the NOTUVY umbrella.
  This page provides all the information needed to apply for the
  JetBrains Open Source Program.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the previous licence granted was for the project "Fsgrep".
  That has now become one of several projects being developed which
  use IntelliJ.
  Now the license is being applied for "NOTUVY", which is the umbrella
  group of several open source projects.
</p>
<p>
  The reason that the parent project is applicant for the license is that
  different sub-projects see different activity levels over time.
  One project may appear dormant over the life of the license period, but
  others will be active.
  By linking it to the parent project, it is possible to see the there
  continuous development occuring.

  <tr>
    <td class="prname">Fsgrep</td>
    <td>Fsgrep is a simple Java application which allows a user to search all files in a directory structure for lines matching a given pattern. Its basic functionality is a combination of the Unix 'find' and 'grep' utilities. Its power is that is allows use of regular expressions in the search pattern, and it also has a multiple-file search and replace functionality.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="prname">NOTUVY&nbsp;util</td>
    <td>General utilities and tools to simplify creating new standalone applications.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="prname">NOTUVY&nbsp;regex</td>
    <td>NOTUVY regex is a wrapper around the standard Java java.util.regex package. It adds no new functionality, but it makes writing sophisiticated regex logic simpler and cleaner than the standard package.</td>
  </tr>
